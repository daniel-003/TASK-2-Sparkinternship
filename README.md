# TASK-2-Sparkinternship
From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

THEORY:
To predict the optimum number of clusters for this dataset, we can use a technique called "K-means clustering."
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to identify groups or clusters of similar objects in a dataset. It works by partitioning a dataset into K clusters, where K is a user-defined parameter representing the number of clusters to be created. The algorithm then iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center and recalculates the cluster centers until convergence.
To implement K-means clustering on the Iris dataset, we first need to import the necessary libraries and load the dataset. We can use the pandas and sklearn libraries to do this.
